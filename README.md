# Scaffold-Master
## ScaffoldGeneratorTest
__Class ScaffoldGeneratorTest shows the funktions of the ScaffoldGenerator

  A set of mol files is loaded from the resources folder, processed with the ScaffoldGenerator and saved as image in the generated scaffoldTestOutput. 
  The ScaffoldGenerator method getSchuffenhauerScaffold() transforms the molecules in Schuffenhauer scaffolds.

## MurckoFragmenterTest

__Class MurckoFragmenterTest shows the funktions of the CDK MurckoFragmenter__
  
  A set of mol files is loaded from the resources folder and processed with the MurckoFragmenter. The following molecules are saved as image in the generated scaffoldTestOutput:
  * Original: The unchanged molecule
  * Fragments: The fragments generated by the MurckoFragmenter
  * Rings: The rings generated by the MurckoFragmenter
  * Frameworks: The frameworks generated by the MurckoFragmenter
  
  Examples:
  * *Test1* shows that linkers are not further decomposed
  * *Test3* shows that ring systems are separated from one another
  * *Test6* shows that side chains of the ring systems are removed and ring systems are not further broken down into individual rings
